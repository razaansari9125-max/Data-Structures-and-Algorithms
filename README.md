# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my **DSA Repository**! 🚀  
This repo contains my practice, handwritten notes, and implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms** in **Java**.  
It is designed to strengthen problem-solving skills, improve coding efficiency, and prepare for **technical interviews**.
